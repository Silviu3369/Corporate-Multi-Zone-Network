PROJECT Corporate Multi-Zone Network

Author: Ghimpau Ionel Silviu
Environment: Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x ( IOS 15.x / ASA 9.6(1) )
Topology: Dual-Hub DMVPN ( GRE over IPsec AES-256 ) with 4 zones
Routing: OSPF Area 0 | Redundancy: HSRP
Security: ASA Firewall + Zone-Based Firewall + ACL + NAT Exempt

1. GENERAL OVERVIEW

The Corporate Multi-Zone Network interconnects four enterprise zones through a secure, redundant dual-hub architecture based on DMVPN over IPsec.
Each zone is logically segmented using dedicated VLANs, redundant Layer-3 gateways (HSRP), and centralized security mechanisms implemented with ASA firewalls and Zone-Based Firewall (ZBF) policies.

This design provides:

High availability through dual routers, redundant cores, and failover mechanisms.

End-to-end encryption between all sites using AES-256 IPsec tunnels.

Centralized management of NTP, SYSLOG, and SSH across all infrastructure devices.

Scalable segmentation, allowing future zones or departments to be integrated easily without redesigning the core.

In summary, the Corporate Multi-Zone Network ensures a unified, secure, and resilient enterprise connectivity model that supports centralized services, remote branches, and secure DMZ hosting within a single managed infrastructure.

2 ZONE 1 – HQ (SPOKE 1)
2.1 Role

Zone 1 acts as the Headquarters branch. It hosts local staff and IT operations and provides secure DMVPN access to the Server Farm (Zone 2).
This zone is a spoke in the DMVPN overlay with redundant connectivity to both Hubs.

2.2 Logical Design

Core Routing: OSPF Area 0 (passive on VLANs)

VPN Connectivity: Dual Hub DMVPN over IPsec (AES-256)

Default Gateway: HSRP VIP on each VLAN (.1)

NAT Boundary: EDGE-ZONE1 toward ISP

DHCP Relay Target: 192.168.40.5 (in Zone 2 DMZ)

6 CORE SERVICES AND SECURITY
6.1 DMVPN / IPsec

Phase 2 dual-hub topology, AES-256 encryption, SHA-1 auth, DH Group 2.

NHRP configured for dynamic mapping.

Split-tunnel policy prevents hair-pinning.

6.2 Routing (OSPF Backbone)

Single Area 0 for all zones.

Passive on VLANs; active on /30 links and tunnels.

Dynamic route exchange between spokes via hubs.

6.3 Security Architecture

The Project Blaze network follows Cisco’s Defense-in-Depth principle.
Each network layer (edge, core, access) applies distinct protection mechanisms for isolation, filtering, and inspection.

6.3.1 Perimeter Security (ASA Firewalls)

Two ASA firewalls — ASA1 (Hub1 perimeter) and ASA2 (Hub2 perimeter) — secure ingress and egress traffic from the Server Farm (Zone 2).

Main Roles:

Control inbound/outbound traffic between DMZ (192.168.40.0/24) and outside networks.

Apply NAT Exempt rules for intra-VPN communication (LAN ↔ 10.255.x.x).

Provide static NAT for public web access (e.g. 192.168.40.7 → Public IP).

Enforce ACL policies and inspection rules for HTTP, SSH, and DNS.

Maintain security levels (100 inside → 0 outside) to define trust boundaries.

Logging & Monitoring:
All ASA logs are exported to the central SYSLOG server (192.168.50.7) and timestamps are synchronized with NTP (192.168.50.6).

6.3.2 Internal Segmentation (ZBF on Edge Routers)

Each Edge router implements a Zone-Based Firewall (ZBF) to segment internal, VPN, management, and external traffic.

Security zones used across all Edges:

Zone	Function	Typical Interfaces
INTERNAL	LAN + VLANs traffic	Gi0/0 (SVI to MS switches)
VPN	Encrypted DMVPN tunnels	Tunnel10 / Tunnel20
MGMT	SSH / NTP / SYSLOG VLANs	VLAN 5 / 55 / 60 / 95
OUTSIDE	WAN links toward ISP	Serial interfaces

Policies applied:

ALLOW-INTERNAL: permits internal routing and management between VLANs.

ALLOW-VPN: allows IPsec / GRE tunnel establishment and OSPF exchange.

ALLOW-MGMT: permits SSH/NTP/SYSLOG only from management VLANs.

DEFAULT-DROP: all other inter-zone traffic denied by default.

This structure enforces east-west segmentation while keeping full control of DMVPN tunnels and management flows.

6.3.3 Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Standardized ACL framework across all zones:

ACL Name	Purpose	Applied on
NAT-EXEMPT	Bypass NAT for VPN traffic	Edge routers & ASA
SSH-MGMT	Allow SSH from VLAN 5/55/60/95 only	All devices
OUTSIDE-IN	Restrict external access to published servers (e.g. Web, DNS)	ASA outside
ZBF-POLICY	Define inspection classes	Edges (policy-map)

All ACLs are synchronized with centralized documentation and version-controlled during network maintenance.

6.4 Network Address Translation (NAT)

NAT is implemented exclusively at the Edge routers and ASA firewalls.

Key principles:

NAT Overload (PAT): for Internet access via ISP interfaces.

NAT Exempt: between LAN subnets and DMVPN (10.255.x.x).

Static NAT: for public DMZ services (e.g., Web 192.168.40.7 → public IP).

ASA NAT Table: unified for both Hub1/HUB2 to maintain consistency.

6.5 Management Infrastructure
6.5.1 NTP

Master: 192.168.50.6 (Zone 2 INFRA-MGMT VLAN 50).

All routers, switches, and ASA synchronize to this source.

Time accuracy ensures reliable log correlation and crypto validity.

6.5.2 SYSLOG

Central server: 192.168.50.7 (Zone 2).

All routers and ASA send informational and warning logs.

Supports event correlation for DMVPN, HSRP, and ACL monitoring.

6.5.3 SSH Management

Enabled only on dedicated MGMT VLANs (.5, .55, .60, .95).

Login access restricted by SSH-MGMT ACL.

Passwords and secrets are encrypted; SSH v2 mandatory.

6.5.4 DHCP & DNS

DHCP centralized in Zone 2 (192.168.40.5).

DNS (192.168.40.6) resolves all internal hostnames; external DNS restricted.

6.6 Routing Backbone (OSPF Area 0)

A single-area OSPF design interconnects all hubs and spokes.
All VLAN interfaces are passive; only tunnel and /30 links form adjacencies.

Component	Function
HUB1 (EDGE1-ZONE2) & HUB2 (EDGE2-ZONE2)	DR / BDR for DMVPN area
SPOKES (Z1, Z3, Z4)	Non-broadcast neighbors via tunnels
ASA firewalls	Participate as passive interfaces (logging only)
Convergence	~ 3 seconds (fast hellos + priority tuning)
7 OPERATIONAL VERIFICATION & MONITORING
7.1 Network Health Checks

Periodic verification is part of standard operating procedure:

Function	Check	Expected Result
DMVPN	Tunnel adjacency (Hub↔Spoke)	UP / UP on all tunnels
IPsec	SA establishment	AES-256 active, no drops
OSPF	Neighbor status	Full / DR/BDR formed
HSRP	Active/Standby state	MS1 active, MS2 standby
NAT	Translation table	Dynamic entries visible
ASA	Connection table	Established sessions
SYSLOG/NTP	Log time accuracy	≤ 1 sec drift
7.2 Security Validation

ACL audits: verify SSH-MGMT, OUTSIDE-IN, NAT-EXEMPT consistency.

ASA inspections: ensure HTTP and DNS sessions are logged.

ZBF state checks: monitor session counts per zone-pair.

7.3 Monitoring Tools

Syslog analyzer for event aggregation.

SNMP polling for interface statistics and HSRP status.

Packet Tracer simulation tests for DMVPN redundancy validation.

8 BEST PRACTICES & DESIGN COMPLIANCE
Category	Recommendation
Redundancy	Maintain dual hubs and dual MS switches per zone.
Segmentation	Keep management, user, and DMZ networks isolated by VLAN.
Security	Apply principle of least privilege; enforce ACL versioning.
Documentation	Update IP tables and ACL versions after each change.
Backup	Store daily configs on SYSLOG/NTP server in Zone 2.
Monitoring	Implement SNMP traps for DMVPN and HSRP events.

Through its dual-hub DMVPN design, full HSRP redundancy, centralized services, and layered security (ASA + ZBF + ACL), the infrastructure provides:

High Availability through dual routers and switches.

Secure Connectivity via AES-256 IPsec tunnels.

Centralized Management for logs, time, and access control.

Operational Flexibility for adding new zones or remote sites.

This document represents the final integrated configuration and design report of the Blaze Network — compliant with Cisco Design Zone best-practice standards.
